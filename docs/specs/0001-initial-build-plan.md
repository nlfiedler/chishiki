# 0001 — Initial Build Plan

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-07-02

Phased plan for building the WebDAV server in Rust on top of the `dav-server`
crate. See `README.md` for project goals and `CLAUDE.md` for the standing
architecture notes.

## Critical finding: `dav-server` does not implement the two headline features

Per the crate docs (docs.rs/dav-server), it explicitly does **not** support
**RFC 3253 (Delta-V versioning)** or **RFC 5323 (WebDAV SEARCH)** — the two RFCs
the README calls out as the point of the project. It *is* a solid WebDAV
**class 1/2** server (`GET`/`PUT`/`PROPFIND`/`MKCOL`/`COPY`/`MOVE`/`LOCK`) with a
pluggable backend. Versioning and search are therefore ours to build.

What the crate does provide:

- **`DavFileSystem` + `DavFile` + `DavMetaData` + `DavDirEntry`** — traits for a
  fully custom backing store (the hook for the content-addressable blob store).
  Backends can optionally store DAV properties. `GuardedFileSystem` adds access
  control.
- **Lock systems**: `MemLs` (in-memory) and `FakeLs` (minimal, for macOS/Windows
  Finder compatibility).
- **Framework adapters**: native `hyper`/`http` types, plus `actix-web` and
  `warp`; `axum` works too (hyper + tower underneath).
- **Construction**: builder pattern —
  `DavHandler::builder().filesystem(...).locksystem(...).build_handler()` —
  processing `http::Request` → `http::Response`.

**Architectural consequence:** put a thin outer HTTP router (recommend **axum**)
in front of `DavHandler`. The router owns what the crate won't: it intercepts the
`SEARCH` method, serves browser `GET`s with content negotiation, optionally
handles Delta-V methods, and passes everything else through to `DavHandler`.
Versioning lives *inside* our `DavFileSystem` (every write is a new immutable
version, cheap thanks to chunk sharing).

## Reuse goal

Reusable, WebDAV-agnostic pieces — blob store, FastCDC chunker, versioned
metadata, reverse index — live in their own library crates in a Cargo workspace.
The WebDAV/HTTP binary is a thin consumer on top, so the storage engine ships
without dragging WebDAV along.

## Phases

### Phase 0 — Workspace & toolchain
- `git init`; Cargo **workspace** with library crates (`blobstore`, `chunker`,
  `vfs`, `index`) + a binary crate (`webdav-server`).
- rustfmt, clippy (deny warnings in CI), a test harness, and CI. Then replace the
  "Project status" section of `CLAUDE.md` with the real build/test/run commands.

### Phase 1 — Content-addressable blob store (lib: `blobstore` + `chunker`)
- Blob store keyed by content hash (**blake3**); `put`/`get`/`has`, streaming
  read/write.
- **FastCDC** chunking via the `fastcdc` crate; store only unique chunks. A file
  = an ordered manifest of chunk hashes. Reconstruct as a streaming reader.
- Deferred: chunk ref-counting / GC (revisit in Phase 6).

### Phase 2 — Virtualized filesystem + `DavFileSystem` (lib: `vfs`, bin: `webdav-server`)
- Metadata store mapping the virtual path namespace → file manifests + attributes.
  **Engine: SQLite via `rusqlite`** (see Open decisions #1).
- Implement `DavFileSystem`/`DavFile`/`DavMetaData`/`DavDirEntry` over blob store
  + metadata.
- Stand up `DavHandler` + `MemLs`, serve via axum. **Milestone:** mount from
  Finder / `rclone` / `cadaver` and read/write real files (first end-to-end
  checkpoint).

### Phase 3 — Versioning (in `vfs`)
- **Basic auto-versioning first** (see Open decisions #3): every `PUT`/modify
  creates a new immutable version automatically; near-free because unchanged
  chunks are shared. Model version history in the metadata store.
- Expose history pragmatically — a virtual `.versions/` namespace and/or an
  HTTP endpoint — since `dav-server` won't route Delta-V methods.
- **Full RFC 3253 (Delta-V) protocol compliance (`VERSION-CONTROL`, `REPORT`,
  `CHECKOUT`/`CHECKIN`) is _not_ pursued** — see Resolved decision #4. Versioning
  is delivered through the web UI and the `?versions` / `?version=N` / revert /
  prune endpoints instead.

### Phase 4 — Browser layer / content negotiation (in the router)
- Detect browser vs. WebDAV client by `Accept: text/html`. `GET` `.md` → HTML via
  **pulldown-cmark**; `GET` a collection → server-generated HTML index;
  images/videos → raw bytes with HTTP **range request** support (needed for video
  seeking). Realizes the "Browser vs. WebDAV client" section in `CLAUDE.md`.

### Phase 5 — Search / reverse index (lib: `index`)
- On write, tokenize text/markdown and update a reverse index. **Engine:
  `tantivy`** (see Open decisions #2).
- Two surfaces: browser-facing `GET /search?q=…`, and a `SEARCH`-method
  interceptor in the router for RFC 5323 clients.

### Phase 6 — Hardening
- Chunk GC, locking/concurrency correctness, large-file streaming, integration
  tests against real WebDAV clients, and benchmarks.
- **AuthN/AuthZ is _not_ part of this (or any) phase** — it is a cross-cutting
  concern tracked under "Future work" below.

## Resolved decisions
1. **Metadata engine** (Phase 2): **SQLite via `rusqlite`.** `sled` has had very
   slow development for several years; `redb` looks promising but its own README
   comparison shows a notably larger on-disk file size than SQLite. SQLite is a
   very reliable, battle-tested storage library, so it wins.
   _Resolved 2026-07-02._
2. **Search engine** (Phase 5): **`tantivy`.** Full-featured and promising; worth
   the dependency over a hand-rolled inverted index. _Resolved 2026-07-02._
3. **Versioning scope** (Phase 3): **Basic auto-versioning first**, with the
   history surfaced through the web UI and simple HTTP endpoints (superseded on
   the Delta-V question by decision #4). _Resolved 2026-07-02._
4. **Delta-V (RFC 3253) not pursued**: the auto-versioning capability is
   delivered, but the RFC 3253 *protocol* (the `VERSION-CONTROL` / `CHECKOUT` /
   `CHECKIN` / `REPORT` method set and its live properties) is deliberately not
   implemented. There is effectively **no client ecosystem** for Delta-V —
   general-purpose WebDAV clients (Finder, the Windows mini-redirector, `rclone`,
   `davfs2`, `cadaver`) are class-1/2 only, and the one notable deployment
   (Subversion's `mod_dav_svn`) was an SVN-specific derivation, not a target for
   generic clients. Implementing it would be write-only interop: we'd have to
   author our own client just to exercise it, for zero real-world reach. Version
   history is instead delivered via the browser UI and the `?versions` /
   `?version=N` / `?revert` / `?prune` endpoints. RFC 3253 remains a reference/
   inspiration only. _Resolved 2026-07-06._

## Future work (not tied to a phase)

### AuthN/AuthZ

Authentication and authorization is a **cross-cutting** concern, deliberately
**not** attached to any phase: when it lands it gates every surface at once —
the WebDAV method set, the browser pages, the `?q=` search surfaces, and the
currently-unauthenticated `?revert` / `?prune` / `?gc` POST writes. Until then
the server ships **unauthenticated** and must be bound to `127.0.0.1` or an
otherwise trusted network (see `README.md`).

**Usage model.** Chishiki is a personal server that runs on a home LAN and is
used by **anyone in the household** — so this is genuinely **multi-user**, but
the population is small, trusted, and **not internet-facing** (no adversarial
threat model, no public exposure). That shapes, but does not yet decide, the
design:

- **Mechanism must serve WebDAV clients and browsers over the same URLs.** Finder
  / Windows / `rclone` / `davfs2` speak **HTTP Basic** (and legacy Digest)
  natively but have no cookie/form-login concept; browsers can do Basic (native
  dialog, no logout) or a nicer cookie session. **Basic** is the common
  denominator, which in turn wants **TLS** so LAN credentials aren't sent in the
  clear even on a trusted network.
- **AuthZ is likely coarse to start** — "authenticated ⇒ access", possibly
  read-only vs. read-write, or per-user home subtrees — not fine-grained ACLs.
  `dav-server`'s `GuardedFileSystem` is the access-control hook.
- **Open questions** (to resolve when we build it, not now): shared credential
  vs. per-user accounts; where credentials live (config file, SQLite, env);
  whether to require TLS or leave it to a reverse proxy; session handling for the
  browser surface; and how CSRF protection on the POST writes interacts with an
  auth scheme.

A dedicated design spec will be written when this is picked up.
